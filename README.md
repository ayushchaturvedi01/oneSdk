# oneSdk

**A Vision for Unified Development Tools**

**oneSdk** is an ambitious, research-driven project aiming to create a modular and unified collection of Software Development Kits (SDKs) to simplify and accelerate modern application development. Designed for web, mobile, and backend developers, `oneSdk` envisions a cohesive ecosystem where multiple specialized SDKs work seamlessly together, reducing complexity and empowering developers to focus on building great products.

> **Note**: `oneSdk` is currently in the research and planning phase. This README outlines our vision, planned features, and the exciting journey ahead. Stay tuned for updates as we bring this project to life!

## Why oneSdk?

Managing multiple libraries, SDKs, and APIs for tasks like databases, payments, authentication, and storage can be a nightmare. Our research shows developers crave a unified solution that simplifies integration without sacrificing flexibility. `oneSdk` is our answer—a single, interoperable package that combines specialized SDKs for common development needs.

### Key Goals
- **Unified Ecosystem**: A single package housing modular SDKs for databases, payments, and more.
- **Interoperability**: SDKs designed to work together seamlessly.
- **Developer-Centric**: Intuitive APIs, TypeScript support, and comprehensive documentation.
- **Extensibility**: Easy integration with existing tools and frameworks.
- **Open Source**: A community-driven project, transparent and free to use.

## Planned SDKs in oneSdk

`oneSdk` is envisioned as a growing ecosystem. Our research has identified the following SDKs as initial components:

1. **[commonDatabase](#commondatabase)**: A universal database wrapper for ORMs like Drizzle, Prisma, Mongoose, Cassandra, and more, with enhanced features like caching and query optimization.
2. **[commonPayment](#commonpayment)**: A unified payment gateway wrapper for providers like Razorpay, Cashfree, Stripe, PayPal, and others, simplifying payment integration.
3. *More SDKs Planned*: Authentication (`authSdk`), file storage (`storageSdk`), and messaging (`messagingSdk`) are on the horizon.


## Our Research

Our team has conducted extensive research to ensure `oneSdk` meets real-world developer needs:
- **Database Challenges**: Developers struggle with inconsistent APIs across ORMs like Prisma, Mongoose, and Drizzle. `commonDatabase` will provide a unified interface.
- **Payment Integration Pain Points**: Integrating multiple payment gateways (e.g., Razorpay, Stripe) involves redundant code and complex error handling. `commonPayment` will abstract these complexities.
- **Developer Feedback**: Surveys and interviews with developers highlight the need for modular, interoperable tools with strong TypeScript support and clear documentation.

This research forms the foundation of `oneSdk`, ensuring it addresses real pain points and delivers value.

## Planned Features

### commonDatabase
- Unified API for ORMs (Prisma, Drizzle, Mongoose, Cassandra, etc.).
- Enhanced features: query caching, transaction management, and query optimization.
- Cross-database support for SQL, NoSQL, and more.
- Plugin system for custom extensions (e.g., logging, auditing).

### commonPayment
- Unified API for payment gateways (Razorpay, Cashfree, Stripe, PayPal, etc.).
- Simplified payment flows: payments, refunds, subscriptions, and webhooks.
- Built-in error handling and retry mechanisms.
- Support for multiple currencies and regional payment methods.

### General oneSdk Features
- Modular architecture to include only the SDKs you need.
- TypeScript-first design for type safety and developer productivity.
- Extensive documentation and examples for quick onboarding.
- Community-driven development with open contributions.
